# This is a time zone converter


This app will tell you the current time of anywhere you choose.

1. First you need you open the Git Bash Terminal.

2. Type this out " node tz.js (the time zone you want) "

3. Press enter.

You will see that the time it says it is, is a bit confusing to read.

To fix this all you need to do is add this flag at the end.

" node tz.js (the time zone you want) --format "

This will make the date and time readible.
